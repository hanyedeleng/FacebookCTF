Reversing - Screts of Reverse Engineering

The idea is simple: we should develop a solid understanding of low-level
software, and learn tecniques that will allow us to easily dig into any
program's binaries and retrieve information.

It's deconstructed
similar to scientific research that studies natural phenomena.

In some cases source code is available but the original developers who created
it are unavailable. This book deals specifically with what is commonly referred
to as binary reverse engineering.

Binary reverse engineering techqiues aim at extracting valuable information
from programs for which source code is unavailable.

Reverse engineering is often platform-specific. It is affected by the specific
operating system and hardware platform used. The primary operating system used
throughtout this book is Microsoft Windows, and for a good reason. Windows is
the most popular reverse engineering environment, and not only because it is
the most popular operating system in general.
It's lovely opensource alternative Linux, for example, is far less relevant
from a reversing standpoint precisely because the operating system and most of
the software that runs on top of it are open-source.
