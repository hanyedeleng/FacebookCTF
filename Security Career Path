Roles:
I primarily split up infosec jobs into internal network security, product security, and consulting. I further break down these classes of
jobs into the following roles:
1. Application Security (code audits/app assessments)
2. Attacker (offensive)
3. Compliance
4. Forensics
5. Incident Handler
6. Manager
7. Network Security Engineer
8. Penetration Tester
9. Policy
10. Researcher
11. Reverse Engineer
12. Security Architect



Security Engineering: A guide to building dependable distributed system.
I 4 environments: a bank, an air force base, a hospital, and the home.  (finance?)

Good security engineering requires four things to come together. 
There's policy: what you're supposed to achieve.
There's mechanism: the ciphers, access controls, hardware tamper-resistance and other machinery that you assemble in order to implement 
the policy.
There's assurance: the amount of reliance you can place on each particular mechanism.
There's incentive: the motive that the people guarding and maintaining the system have to do their job properly, and also the motive that
the attackers have to try to defeat your policy.

Civil engineers learn far more from the one bridge that falls down thatn from the hundred that stay up; exactly the same holds in 
security engineering.


System:
1. a product or component, such as a cryptographic protocol, a smartcard or the hardware of a PC;
2. a collection of the above plus an operating system, communications and other things that go to make up an organization's infrastructure.
3. the above plus one or more applications (media player, browser, word processor, accounts/payroll package, and so on).
4. any or all of the above plus IT staff;
5. any or all of the above plus internal users and management;
6. any or all of the above plus customers and other external uses.
